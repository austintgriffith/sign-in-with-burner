# Demo of "Sign in with BurnerWallet" functionality

## How to run it
- Clone down the repo
- npm i
- node burner/server.js
- ##Open another console
- node client/server.js
- go to localhost:3001


The actual signing is not being done at the moment. But can be trivially added.
This is a proof of concept for ironing out the handshaking protocol and formualting a nice library for dapp devs to download.
